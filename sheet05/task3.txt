What is a race condition?
A race condition is when 2 or more processes try to access the same data and at least one
modifies it. So the result can be wrong.

Why do race conditions occur?
If there is not synchronization between the processes, it's not predictable wich process 
accesses the data first.

Is the output of a program with a race condition always incorrect?
No, if the right process accesses the data before the other, then it could be right.

If you run your program 100 times and always get the correct result, does that mean that there is no race condition?
No, because this could be just a coincidence.

What is synchronization?
When one process can finish it's work before a other process tries to consume the data.

Why are semaphores well suited for synchronizing producer-consumer patterns?
Because it's just a very simple implementation and it fits our needs.

Could Task 2 also be implemented using a single semaphore?
Yes but then you need to implement, that the Producer accesses the data before the consumer.
